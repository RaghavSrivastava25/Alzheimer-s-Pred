            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>THE STRESS-PASSERS is an a initiative cum project started by us few students of IILM UNIVERSITY
                GREATER NOIDA. We are planning to be build a open source software and website for people 
                suffering from mental health related issues. The begging of the initiative will involve
                day to day blogs of how to handle stress of all kinds. Tips and advices to increase your
                willpower , mental resistance , sharpen your memory , also case studies and personal life stories
                of people who experienced a subtle but personally drastic changes in their mental health and were able to come out of it.
                Further the initiative will come up with a trained model which can read MRI scans of patients with chronic 
                mental or brain related issues, there by saving costs and time to get an endless chain chain of appointments to 
                the hospitals. In future the page will be open to everyone , people can share their stories, advices , 
                modify the model and interact with each other. Resulting in a self sustained helpoing environment.</p>

         <h3>*idea of "OPEN SOURCE MRI SCANNER":</h3>
         <p>People suffer a lot for getting their mri scannes done and also the reports are not more accurate
            if not done properly or due to lack of more precise machinery. India has a few number of trusted labs
            who are performing such high accuracy demanding scans,this has resulted in monopoly of such few companies
            over this and has converted this serious health issue more into their marketing field and making huge profits.
            We "THE STRESS-PASSERS" have come up with this public welfare approach to develope an open source MRI SCANNER,
            which will be available to everyone. Also the model will be self evolving over the period to predict in which portion of the 
            brain the patient is suffering and accordingly suggest cure.This is help people of all strata to have health benefits.

         <p>Many times we just need someone to share with our problems,our querry,our situation. But in this busy world nobody has got anytime
            for others, we intend to build a an environment where people can freely and frankly share their problems through blogs,posts,stories,
            podcasts by getting connected to our various platforms. people can get to know about variousproblems other people are suffering and also 
            suggest each other ways to deal with it . This will help to build a self healing interactive environment.
            people will get relief after sharing their case studies and it will help them to improve their mental stamina. Come and join our family!
